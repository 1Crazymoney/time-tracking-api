This is a simple REST API server that works in conjuction with a front end user
interface. It allows groups of developers to easily and transparently track
time spent on projects. This information can then be used to compensate them with
tokens.

This repository is forked from
the [koa-api-boilerplate](https://github.com/christroutner/koa-api-boilerplate).
The original application was refactored
from [this ConnextCMS plugin](https://github.com/christroutner/rpiovn).
